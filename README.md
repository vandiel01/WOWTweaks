# WoW Tweaks
It's a basic stuff with "scripts" but automatically done for you upon login:
1. When at merchant vendor, it automatically change filter to "Show All Class"
2. When at merchant vendor, it will automatically sell all grey items
3. Chat Message will no longer Fade (disappear)

## About Me
I'm Vandiel, in ATT on Discord (Vandiel#2276) and on Korgath.  I'm by no means a expert programmer/coder, but like to learn and experiment things.  I'm always happy to have some insight and/or improvement to the code.
